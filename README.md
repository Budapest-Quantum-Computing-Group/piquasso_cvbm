# On the learning abilities of photonic continuous-variable Born machines

This repository contains the source code for the article "On the learning abilities of photonic continuous-variable Born machines".

The simulations are executed with Python 3.10.13, and the requirements are found in `requirements.txt`.

For executing the scripts, please install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. to ensure that the correct version of `piquasso` is used, it is advised to use a `virtualenv`. Note also, that `matplotlib` uses TeX for the plots.

The data for the 2-mode simulations can be obtained by
```
python3 d_2_script.py
```
which saves the data in the `data/` folder. The figures in the article can be generated by
```
python3 d_2_plot.py data/<FILENAME>
```
Similarly for the 3- and 4-mode simulations.

The gradient estimation script from Fig. 6 can be executed with
```
python3 gradient_estimation.py
```

For the benchmark in Fig. 1, execute
```
python3 benchmark.py
```
which saves the data in the `data/` folder, and execute it with
```
python3 benchmark_plot.py data/<FILENAME>
```
